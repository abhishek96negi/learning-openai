event after login. All the attachments of the event are saved in the 
organiser's google drive and he is able to give access to a particular 
person. After the meeting, the transcripts are stored in csv and json 
format and stored in an amazon s3 bucket and the database respectively. 
The tool also captures the attendance list of people who are joining the 
meet and absent in the meet, and uses the transcript json and the 
attendance list to create a statistical metric.

History of documentation;The Document History section of the Technical 
Specification Document (TSD) for Rapid Trance Version 1.0 outlines the 
date, author, and summary of changes for each version of the document.
What is bot ?; A bot is a software application that is programmed to 
perform a specific task or set of tasks. Bots are used to automate a 
variety of tasks, such as responding to customer inquiries, managing 
customer service interactions, booking tickets, and more.
How bot is joining the meet?; After the meeting is created, the Rapid 
Innovation bot joins the meet with captions on and fetches all transcripts 
(live captions) from the meet by using selenium python and also uses the 
beautiful soup python library to get accurate captions from the meet. 
After the meeting ends, the transcripts are saved to csv and json format. 
The csv is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket and the json of transcripts is 
saved in the database.
what is behind process of bot to join meet?; After creating an event, the 
Rapid Innovation bot uses a crontab to hit a post API and create a task in 
a celery queue. The bot then joins the meeting with captions on and 
fetches all transcripts from the meet using the Selenium Python library 
and the Beautiful Soup Python library. After the meeting ends, the 
transcripts are saved in a csv file and a json format. The csv is stored 
in an Amazon S3 bucket and the json of transcripts is saved in the 
database.
